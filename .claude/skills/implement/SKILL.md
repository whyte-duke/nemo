# Implement Plan

Implement phases from: **$ARGUMENTS/plan.md**

## Architecture

This skill is a **thin dispatcher**. It does NOT read references, extract patterns, or implement code. Builders handle implementation, validators handle review, and auditors handle cross-phase analysis.

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| **Orchestrator (you)** | Parse groups, gate checks, spawn/shutdown agents, route verdicts, triage auditor findings, track cross-group state |
| **Builder** | Phase implementation: read phase, find references, invoke skills, code, test, typecheck. Does NOT review its own code. |
| **Validator** | Independent review: runs `/code-review` (reference-grounded, with auto-fix), then typecheck + tests. Reports PASS/FAIL. |
| **Auditor** | Group-level audit: cross-phase regressions, deferred items, plan drift, system integrity. Read-only — reports findings with severity ratings. |

**All agents are ephemeral.** Each gets a fresh 200K context and is shut down after its cycle. This prevents context contamination, ensures skill instructions are never compacted, and eliminates bottlenecks.

**Builders run in isolated git worktrees.** Each builder gets `isolation: "worktree"` — a separate working directory with its own branch. This prevents parallel builders from corrupting each other's files. The builder commits to its worktree branch, the orchestrator merges the branch into the main tree, and the validator runs on the merged result. If validation fails, `git revert` cleanly undoes the merge.

### Processing Model

```
for each group (sequential):
  1. Gate check all phases in group
  2. Build phases (parallel where deps allow)
  3. Validate each phase (PASS/FAIL routing)
  4. When all group phases PASS → spawn auditor
  5. Orchestrator reads auditor report and triages:
     - Clean/Low → log deviations, continue to next group
     - Medium → auto-spawn builder + validator to fix
     - High/Critical → checkpoint with user, then fix
  6. Track deviation summary for next group's auditor
```

## Step 1: Read and Review the Plan

1. Read the plan file at `$ARGUMENTS/plan.md`
2. Check if `$ARGUMENTS/reviews/planning/plan.md` exists
3. If no review exists, run `/review-plan $ARGUMENTS` first
4. **Read the review file** at `$ARGUMENTS/reviews/planning/plan.md`
5. **Check the Verdict section:**
   - If `Yes` → proceed to Step 2
   - If `No` → **STOP** and report the Critical Issues to the user

## Step 2: Check Flow Audit

**1. Count phases** in the Phase Table.

**2. Skip for small plans:** If 1-2 phases, skip to Step 3.

**3. Check if audit exists:** Look for `$ARGUMENTS/reviews/planning/flow-audit.md`.

**4. If missing:** STOP and tell the user to run `/audit-plan $ARGUMENTS` first.

**5. Gate logic:**

| Overall Assessment | Behaviour |
|--------------------|----------|
| **"Unusable"** | **HARD BLOCK:** STOP. Plan is fundamentally broken — needs restructuring. |
| **"Major Restructuring Needed"** | **HARD BLOCK:** STOP. Report issues to user. |
| **"Significant Issues"** | **SOFT BLOCK:** WARN user. Ask whether to proceed or fix. |
| **"Minor Issues"** or **"Coherent"** | **PROCEED.** |

## Step 3: Parse Groups and Build Execution Plan

**3a: Check for existing tasks (compact recovery):**

Run `TaskList` first. If tasks already exist from a previous session or context compact:
1. Read existing tasks with `TaskGet` for each task ID
2. If any task is `in_progress` — resume from that point
3. Do NOT recreate the task list

**3b: Parse the Phase Table and Group Summary:**

Read plan.md's Phase Table. For each phase, extract: number, title, group, focus, status, dependencies.

Read the Group Summary table to get group ordering and descriptions.

Build a group execution plan:

```
groups = [
  { name: "auth-system", phases: [P01, P02, P03], description: "..." },
  { name: "dashboard-ui", phases: [P04, P05, P06, P07], description: "..." },
  ...
]
```

Groups are processed sequentially in the order listed in the Group Summary. Phases within a group are processed in parallel where dependencies allow.

If all phases are done:
1. Report completion to the user
2. Skip to Step 10 (cleanup)

**3c: Create orchestrator tasks (first run only):**

If no tasks exist yet, create tasks with **rich, self-contained descriptions**:

```
TaskCreate({
  subject: "Group: {group-name} — Phase {NN}: {title}",
  description: `Phase file: $ARGUMENTS/phase-{NN}-{slug}.md
Group: {group-name} ({N} phases in group: P{NN}, P{MM}, ...)
Skill: {skill-from-frontmatter}
Dependencies: {list or "none"}

Key deliverables from acceptance criteria:
- {criterion 1}
- {criterion 2}
- {criterion 3}

Gate check → build → validate → mark done.
After all phases in group "{group-name}" complete, spawn auditor for group review.`,
  activeForm: "Implementing Phase {NN} ({group-name})"
})
```

Then set up dependencies with `TaskUpdate` using `addBlockedBy` to mirror each phase's `dependencies` frontmatter.

Also create one task per group for the audit step:

```
TaskCreate({
  subject: "Audit group: {group-name}",
  description: `Spawn auditor after all phases in group complete.
Group: {group-name}
Phases: P{NN}, P{MM}, ...
Plan folder: $ARGUMENTS

Auditor reviews: cross-phase regressions, deferred items, plan drift, acceptance criteria.
Triage: Clean/Low → continue. Medium → auto-fix. High/Critical → ask user.`,
  activeForm: "Auditing group {group-name}"
})
```

Set audit tasks to be blocked by all phase tasks in their group.

**3d: Determine current group and unblocked phases:**

Find the first group with pending phases. Within that group, identify unblocked phases (all dependencies satisfied).

## Step 4: Gate Check Phases

Before spawning builders, gate-check each unblocked phase. Mark each phase task as `in_progress`:

```
TaskUpdate({ taskId: "{phase-task-id}", status: "in_progress" })
```

**4a: Check for skeleton/placeholder content:**

```bash
echo '{"cwd":"."}' | uv run $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/validators/validate_no_placeholders.py \
  --directory $ARGUMENTS --extension .md
```

If non-zero exit, the phase contains placeholder content. **STOP** — do not spawn a builder for a skeleton phase.

**4b: Verify the phase review:**

1. Check if `$ARGUMENTS/reviews/planning/phase-{NN}.md` exists
2. If no review exists, run `/review-plan $ARGUMENTS phase {NN}`
3. **Read the review Verdict:**
   - **Ready: Yes** → proceed to Step 5
   - **Ready: No** → **FIX the phase first**, re-run review, then proceed

## Step 5: Create Team (First Run Only)

Create the team on the first run. Reuse it across all groups.

```
TeamCreate({
  team_name: "{plan-name}-impl",
  description: "Implementation team for {plan title}"
})
```

## Concurrency Limits

**Hard cap: 4 total active agents (builders + validators + auditor combined).** The auditor runs alone — no builders or validators during audit.

| Constraint | Limit | Why |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| Builders per batch | Max 2 | Context pressure from parallel completions |
| Validators per batch | Max 2 (one per active builder) | Each builder gets one validator |
| **Total active agents** | **Max 4** | Orchestrator context budget |
| Auditor | **Runs alone** | Needs undivided orchestrator attention for triage |
| Batch overlap | **None** | Wait for current batch to fully complete before next |

## Step 6: Spawn Builders

Spawn a fresh builder for each unblocked phase that passed gate-checking. **Max 2 builders per batch.**

**Before spawning, extract the `skill:` field from each phase's YAML frontmatter.**

```
Task({
  description: "Implement phase {NN}",
  subagent_type: "builder",
  model: "opus",
  team_name: "{plan-name}-impl",
  name: "builder-1",
  mode: "bypassPermissions",
  isolation: "worktree",
  prompt: `Implement the phase at: $ARGUMENTS/phase-{NN}-{slug}.md
Plan folder: $ARGUMENTS
Skill: {skill-from-frontmatter}

Your first action: invoke the builder-workflow skill via Skill({ skill: "builder-workflow" }). It teaches you how to:
1. Read the phase and extract requirements
2. Invoke the Skill above (if not "none") and find reference files
3. Create internal tasks (TaskCreate) for each step — prefix with [Step]. This is REQUIRED for context compact recovery
4. Implement with TDD (Step 0 first), marking tasks in_progress/completed as you go
5. Run tests and typecheck
6. Commit all changes to your worktree branch before reporting
7. Report completion to team-lead (do NOT run /code-review — the validator handles that independently)

WORKTREE: You are in an isolated git worktree with your own branch. Your changes are invisible to other builders. You MUST commit before reporting completion — uncommitted changes cannot be merged. Use: git add -A && git commit -m "feat(phase-{NN}): {phase-title}"

IMPORTANT: Before using the Write tool on any existing file, you MUST Read it first or the write will silently fail.`
})
```

## Step 7: Wait and Route Builder/Validator Cycle

Wait for builder completion messages. When a builder reports done:

### 7a: Merge Worktree Branch

The builder's Task result includes a `branch` field (the worktree branch). Merge it into the main working tree before validation:

```bash
git merge --no-ff {worktree-branch} -m "merge: phase {NN} - {title}"
```

If the merge has conflicts:
1. Attempt auto-resolution for trivial conflicts (import ordering, formatting)
2. If non-trivial conflicts exist, **STOP** and report to the user — manual resolution needed

### 7b: Spawn Validator

After successful merge, spawn a fresh validator. The validator runs on the main tree (no worktree) to verify the integrated result:

```
Task({
  description: "Validate phase {NN}",
  subagent_type: "validator",
  team_name: "{plan-name}-impl",
  name: "validator-{N}",
  mode: "bypassPermissions",
  prompt: `Validate phase {NN} on the {plan-name}-impl team. Follow the workflow defined in your agent instructions.

Phase file: $ARGUMENTS/phase-{NN}-{slug}.md
Plan folder: $ARGUMENTS

Run /code-review against the phase file, then verify with typecheck + tests. Report PASS/FAIL to team-lead via SendMessage.`
})
```

### 7c: Wait for ALL validator verdicts in this batch before proceeding.

### Handle Verdict

**PASS:**
1. Update phase YAML frontmatter: `status: done`
2. Update Phase Table in plan.md: status → "Done"
3. Mark the phase task as completed
4. Shutdown the builder and validator for this phase
5. When the entire batch is complete, check: are ALL phases in the current group done?
   - **Yes** → proceed to Step 8 (Group Audit)
   - **No** → loop back to find next unblocked phases in this group, spawn next batch

**FAIL:**
1. Revert the worktree merge to restore a clean main branch:
   ```bash
   git revert --no-edit HEAD
   ```
2. Shutdown current builder AND validator (both contexts may be stale)
3. Spawn a **fresh builder** (with `isolation: "worktree"`) with the validator's fix instructions
4. Wait for fix builder → merge branch → spawn fresh validator → re-validate → repeat until PASS

## Step 8: Group Audit

When all phases in a group have passed validation, spawn an auditor for the group.

**Mark the group audit task as `in_progress`:**

```
TaskUpdate({ taskId: "{audit-task-id}", status: "in_progress" })
```

**Shutdown all builders and validators from this group first** — the auditor runs alone.

**Spawn the auditor:**

```
Task({
  description: "Audit group {group-name}",
  subagent_type: "auditor",
  model: "opus",
  team_name: "{plan-name}-impl",
  name: "auditor-{group-name}",
  mode: "bypassPermissions",
  prompt: `Audit the "{group-name}" phase group.

Plan folder: $ARGUMENTS
Group: {group-name}
Phases in this group:
- Phase {NN}: {title} — $ARGUMENTS/phase-{NN}-{slug}.md
- Phase {MM}: {title} — $ARGUMENTS/phase-{MM}-{slug}.md
[...list all phases in group...]

Previous group deviations:
{deviation-summary-from-previous-groups OR "None — this is the first group."}

Your first action: invoke the auditor-workflow skill via Skill({ skill: "auditor-workflow" }). It teaches you how to:
1. Read all group phases and build inventory
2. Collect and review code reviews for group phases
3. Check deferred items against current code
4. Cross-phase impact analysis (shared files, imports, overwrites)
5. Run verification (tests + typecheck)
6. Plan vs implementation comparison (acceptance criteria, ADRs)
7. Consider previous groups' deviations
8. Write audit report to $ARGUMENTS/reviews/implementation/group-{group-name}-audit.md
9. Report findings to team-lead with severity ratings

IMPORTANT: You are READ-ONLY. Do not modify source code. Write only the audit report file.`
})
```

## Step 9: Triage Auditor Findings

When the auditor reports back, **read the full audit report** at `$ARGUMENTS/reviews/implementation/group-{group-name}-audit.md`.

**9a: Create tasks from findings FIRST (compact safety):**

Before spawning any fix builders, create tasks for each finding that needs action. This ensures findings survive context compaction:

```
TaskCreate({
  subject: "Fix: {finding summary} (group {group-name})",
  description: `From auditor report: $ARGUMENTS/reviews/implementation/group-{group-name}-audit.md

Severity: {Critical/High/Medium/Low}
Phase: P{NN}
File: {file:line from auditor report}
Issue: {description from auditor report}
Suggested fix: {fix from auditor report}`,
  activeForm: "Fixing {finding summary}"
})
```

**9b: Triage by severity:**

| Finding Severity | Action |
|-----------------|--------|
| **No issues / Low only** | Log deviation summary, mark audit task complete, continue to next group |
| **Medium** | Auto-spawn builder to fix + validator to verify. No user input needed. |
| **High / Critical** | **Checkpoint with user.** Present the findings and ask for direction before proceeding. |

**9c: For Medium findings — auto-fix cycle:**

1. Spawn a builder (with `isolation: "worktree"`) with the specific fix instructions from the auditor report
2. Wait for builder completion → merge worktree branch (same as Step 7a)
3. Spawn validator to verify the fix on main
4. If PASS → mark fix task complete
5. If FAIL → revert merge, retry (max 3 attempts per finding, then escalate to user)

**9d: For High/Critical findings — user checkpoint:**

Present the auditor's findings to the user:

```
## Group "{group-name}" Audit — Needs Your Input

**Assessment:** {from audit report}

### Critical/High Findings:
1. {finding 1 — severity, phase, file:line, issue}
2. {finding 2}
...

### Auditor's Recommendation:
{from audit report}

**Options:**
1. Fix all — I'll spawn builders for each finding
2. Fix specific items — tell me which ones
3. Skip and continue — accept the findings as-is
4. Stop implementation — address these manually
```

Use `AskUserQuestion` to get the user's choice, then act accordingly.

**9e: Track deviation summary:**

After all findings are resolved (or accepted), build a deviation summary for the next group's auditor:

```
deviation_summaries[group_name] = {
  assessment: "{from audit report}",
  key_deviations: ["{finding 1}", "{finding 2}"],
  unresolved: ["{any findings user chose to skip}"]
}
```

Pass this to the next auditor in its spawn prompt (see Step 8, "Previous group deviations").

**9f: Mark audit task complete and continue:**

```
TaskUpdate({ taskId: "{audit-task-id}", status: "completed" })
```

Shutdown the auditor:

```
SendMessage({ type: "shutdown_request", recipient: "auditor-{group-name}" })
```

Loop back to Step 3 to start the next group.

## Step 10: Cleanup

When all groups are done OR an error breakout condition is met:

1. **Shutdown all active teammates:**

```
// For each active agent:
SendMessage({ type: "shutdown_request", recipient: "{agent-name}" })
```

2. **Delete team:** `TeamDelete()`

3. **Report final summary to user:**

```
## Implementation Complete

**Plan:** $ARGUMENTS
**Groups:** {count} completed
**Phases:** {count} Done

### Group Audit Results:
| Group | Assessment | Critical | High | Medium | Low |
|-------|-----------|----------|------|--------|-----|
| {name} | {verdict} | {N} | {N} | {N} | {N} |

### Unresolved Items:
{any findings the user chose to skip}

### Verification:
- Tests: {pass/fail}
- Typecheck: {pass/fail}
```

**Error breakout conditions** — STOP and shut down if:
- Validator FAIL repeats 3+ times on the same phase
- Auditor finding fix fails 3+ times
- Phase has Critical blocking issues from plan review
- User requests cancellation

---

## Resuming After Context Compact

If you notice context was compacted:

1. Run `TaskList` to see all tasks and their status
2. Find the `in_progress` task — that's where you were
3. Run `TaskGet {id}` on that task for full details
4. Read plan.md to get the Phase Table and Group Summary
5. Check existing audit reports in `$ARGUMENTS/reviews/implementation/` to rebuild deviation summaries
6. Check if team exists: read `~/.claude/teams/{plan-name}-impl/config.json`
   - If team exists, teammates may still be active — coordinate via messages
   - If no team, re-create it
7. Continue from the in_progress task

**Pattern for every work cycle:**
```
TaskList → find in_progress or first pending → TaskGet → continue work → TaskUpdate (completed) → next task
```

Tasks are the orchestrator's source of truth for progress — not memory, not plan.md alone.
